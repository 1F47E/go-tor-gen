Generate TOR onion address using regexp

// generate onion address that starts with name
go-tor-gen ^name 



NOTE: key is 64 bytes and its just ed25519 private key
It will work with bine tor lib as is.

Native tor key is different:
"== ed25519v1-secret: type0 ==\0" header (36 bytes)
The secret key seed (32 bytes)
The public key (32 bytes)

For that you can use https://github.com/rdkr/oniongen-go
